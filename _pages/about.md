👨🏻‍💻 I am a third year undergraduate student at McGill University.

📝 My research interests lie in formal methods and machine learning theory :)

🧮 Geomery and mathematical optimization appeal to me as well!

🔬 I work as a student researcher at Mila AI Institute under the supervision of [Professor Xuejie Si](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~six/) from 2022 - present.

🐱‍💻 I led my team won the first price of [ENG WEEK Hackathon 2022](https://engweek.ca/) with a project named `Study-buddy at McGill`. It is an online real-time friend finder to reduce students’ anxiety and depression caused by the COVID-19 lockdown in 2022.
